# This script should be installed as the XFCE heartbeat-command
# handler.  It will stop xscreensaver from activating if the screen is
# not already locked.
#
# However, if the screen is already locked then this script does
# nothing.
#
# The motivation is that running `xscreensaver-command -deactivate'
# when the screen is already locked causes the password entry dialog
# to appear on screen.  This is unpleasent.  So, if I have screensaver
# blocking enabled, but then manually lock the screen this script
# ensures that we no longer poke xscreensaver.
#
# To install this script run:
#
#  xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/heartbeat-command -s /path/to/script

XSCREENSAVER_COMMAND=xscreensaver-command

# If the screensaver is currently not active, then stop it from
# activating.
if ${XSCREENSAVER_COMMAND} -time | grep non-blanked; then
    ${XSCREENSAVER_COMMAND} -deactivate
